# Leos-Birthday-Bash
The entire codebase for Leo's Birthday Bash. (except Editor scripts)

# Assets
All assets belong to their respective creators and are *off-limits* for use without permission. Feel free to glare at them for uncomfortably long, learn and show them off for educational or demo reasons. Sharing is caring, but stealing would make Leo very upset.
This repository only contains code assets.

# License
License is included in this repository. Please read it before you do anything fancy.
It was not written by a lawyer, so hopefully you can understand it.

In simple terms (And don't use this in place of the license, this is merely a summary, the summary is not legally binding, and it may have errors):
- Include the license notice as a file somewhere easily accessible (including the ASCII kitten) if you modify this code in any distributions of the software.
- Credit me, don't claim it as your own. If you include the notice, you're good to go.
- If anything happens, your fault, and you can't request personal info from me. I am a developer, not an insurance company.
- You can't re-sell the code by itself.
- Don't exploit loopholes. Use intent *and* wording. Otherwise you've breached the contract, and Leo will be sad.
- Be silly. (I can't enforce this though. Be sad or serious or whatever.)

# How to contribute
You don't. I'll gladly use this as an issue tracker, but I'm certainly not interested in legal jargon for obvious reasons.

# Modding
I'll make separate Mono builds starting with 1.1.
These obviously won't perform as well as the regular IL2CPP builds, but the difference is tiny.
Use those to mod the game, or something.
All textures (if I remember correctly) use Full Rect for their sprite shape and can be modified willy-nilly.

# Code sucks
Yes I know.
