All assets belong to their respective creators and are *off-limits* for use without permission. Feel free to glare at them for uncomfortably long, learn and show them off for educational or demo reasons. Sharing is caring, but stealing would make Leo very upset.
This repository only contains code assets.

# How to contribute
You don't. I'll gladly use this as an issue tracker, but I'm certainly not interested in legal jargon for obvious reasons.

# Modding
I'll make separate Mono builds starting with 1.1.
These obviously won't perform as well as the regular IL2CPP builds, but the difference is tiny.
Use those to mod the game, or something.
All textures (if I remember correctly) use Full Rect for their sprite shape and can be modified willy-nilly.

# Code sucks
Yes I know.
